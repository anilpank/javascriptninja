# Document Object Model (DOM)

### Definition
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML, XML and SVG documents.
- It provides a structured representation of the document as a tree.
- The DOM defines methods that allow access to the tree, so that they can change the document structure, style and content.
- The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects.
- Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed. 
- Dom connects web pages to scripts or programming languages.
- Although the DOM is often accessed using JavaScript, it is not a part of the JavaScript language.
