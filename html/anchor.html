            Some items with the test and #1 is blocking the test progression:
1.	The testing died last night due to a failed login.  I had Dave look at it this morning and he believes that the E2mc config is setup for E2proxy passthrough and E2mc does the authentication. I have attached a screenshot of a failed manual login to the url below.
a.	Can someone take a look to make sure that e2mc_tester1 and its password are still viable?
b.	Dave is curious if you intended for the sec. scan to test via the E2mc login or the E2proxy login.
2.	There is a test case that is trying to test https://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/3.2.1/font/fontawesome-webfont.eot . Does that seem reasonable for AppScan to discover that URL in E2mc?

            At the government level, the tension between the two power centres seems to have been coming to an end, but now the real power struggle is for control and command over the party.
In order to further assuage the hurt feelings of Shivpal, Mulayam asked Akhilesh to go to his uncle's residence and have lunch with him and then address a press conference to formally announce that all is well in the family, party and the government.
