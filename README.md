Best practices for Javascript

While working on multiple web projects, we started with Javascript, introduced JQuery, then Ext JS and AngularJS and now contemplating React. While every new library/framework brought some value, technical debt kept piling. So we have decided to go back to Javascript/JQuery so that products can be easily maintained. So here we would cover basics of writing good Javascript and JQuery code.

### WHY

- Javascript is a secondary language for most developers.

- What is 'THIS' - Not very clear to most javascript developers.

- Tools available to us which make our code better.

ECMAScript standards
http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html

### SEMICOLONS
- Semicolons are optional in Javascript (myth)
- Certain ECMAScript statements must be terminated with semicolon.  (ECMAScript standards)
- For convenience. however such semicolons may be omitted from the source text in certain situations. (ECMAScript standards)
- These situations are described by saying that semicolons are automatically inserted. (ECMAScript standards)
- If you want to avoid worrying about all these rules then use semicolons in conjunction with JSHint  (or ESLint) to prevent potential issues.
- Using semicolons has advantage of consistency with other languages.
- Using semicolons prevents .01% of major head breaking issues.
